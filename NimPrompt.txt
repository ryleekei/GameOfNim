Objective:
Develop a C++ program to simulate a game of Nim where a human plays against the computer.

Game Rules:
Two players alternately take marbles from a pile.
In each turn, a player must take at least one but at most half of the marbles.
The player who takes the last marble loses.
Program Requirements:
Initial Setup:

Generate a random initial pile size between PILE_MIN (10) and PILE_MAX (50).
Decide randomly who starts first (computer or human).
Decide randomly if the computer will play a "smart" or "non-smart" move.
Gameplay:

Computer's Turn:
In "smart" mode, make moves to reduce the pile to sizes that are powers of two minus one (1, 3, 7, 15, 31, etc.).
In "non-smart" mode, make random legal moves.
Human's Turn:
Prompt the user to enter a legal move until a valid input is provided.
Display:

Show the current number of marbles after each move using the MARBLE constant.
End Game:

The player who is forced to take the last marble loses.

Special Requirements:
	Functions:

		void computer_play(int& pile, bool smart): Handles the computer's move.
		void player_play(int& pile): Handles the user's move.
	Introduction Message:

		Print a specific welcome message at the start of the game with the developer's name.
